#' Prepare the land input data for the category mapping, checking data for consistency before returning.
#' All "Land" functions deal with area data, as opposed to "Nonland" functions which deal with non-area
#' data such as the amount of applied fertilizer. These are treated differently, because for area
#' data other constraints apply, e.g. the total area must be constant over time.

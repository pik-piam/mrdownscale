#' toolPlantedFromConsistentYears
#'
#' Planted forest where a model's forest parts do not add up to its forest total.
#'
#' In a region-year whose planted, primary and secondary forest differ from the
#' forest total by more than 1\% and 1 Mha, planted forest takes its share of
#' the total from the region's nearest year in which they agree (the earlier
#' year on a tie). Regions in which no year agrees keep what they report.
#' Other region-years are returned unchanged.
#'
#' @param planted magpie object, planted forest (Mha), regions x years
#' @param forest magpie object, forest total (Mha), the same dimensions
#' @param parts magpie object, sum of the reported forest parts (Mha)
#' @return planted, with inconsistent region-years replaced
